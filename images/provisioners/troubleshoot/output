Cancelling build after receiving interrupt
Build 'digitalocean' finished after 3 seconds 638 milliseconds.

Cleanly cancelled builds after being interrupted.
Your build failed :( Please take a look at the errors!
This can happen sometimes, if you have a [404] error while using Linode, this is likely because you need to request support for a larger image size to 18GB!
For support, take a screenshot of the last 20 lines and open a issue at https://github.com/pry0cc/axiom/issues
Sometimes just running a build again can work, so please try at least once: 'axiom-build', thanks!
